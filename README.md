# Logistic Regression using Python

This project implements **Logistic Regression**, one of the most important **classification algorithms** in machine learning. Unlike linear regression, logistic regression predicts **categorical outcomes** by estimating class probabilities using the **sigmoid function**.

---

## 🔍 **Objective**
To build and evaluate a **Logistic Regression model** capable of binary classification, while understanding probability-based decision boundaries.

---

## 🧰 **Tools & Libraries Used**
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** – data processing  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – visualizations  
- **Scikit-learn** – model training, evaluation, metrics  

---

## 📊 **Project Workflow**
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**  
2. **Data Preprocessing** (cleaning, scaling, encoding)  
3. **Model Training** using Logistic Regression  
4. **Prediction** on test data  
5. **Evaluation** using  
   - **Accuracy Score**  
   - **Confusion Matrix**  
   - **Classification Report**  
6. **Visualization** of decision boundaries (if applicable)

---

## 📈 **Results**
The Logistic Regression model successfully classifies data into binary categories by estimating the **probability** of each class. Performance metrics show how effectively the model distinguishes between classes.
